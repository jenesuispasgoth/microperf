# What To Do ? #

As a new programmer or contributor to MicroLauncher, the question of "What can I do?" often comes up. The simplest answer, as for any tool, is to download the tool and start hacking into it. Some are easy and the main contributors have not had the time to fix them. Features are also a good first point since they allow to extend the code base and provide users with something needed or requested.

# Conclusion #

The chapter explained how MicroLauncher is coded and what can be done as a programmer for the tool. It presented coding conventions and the various directories and files that compose the source base. Finally, a programmer or an expert user should know where to start tweaking and modifying the base behavior of MicroLauncher.
