The Benchmark detection tool is used to provide necessary information to both the Microcreator and the Microlaunch tools. The names of the registers, for example, are determined automatically by this tool. This is performed by generating a file containing all relevant architectural information used by both tools.

There is no real need to use MicroDetector alone. It is an auxiliary tool to MicroLauncher and MicroCreator.

To install the tool, refer to [the MicroCreator page](MicroCreator_Chapter_2_Installation#Dependencies.md).
